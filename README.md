Unofficial javascript and 2D version of algorithm in book "Artificial Intelligence for Games". This repo is created as practices for implementing AI in Javascript and also understanding how to make game AI from the book. All this implementation based on pseudo code inside the book, except for structure system and 2D geometry since this project using 2D view.

For the one who want to learning the code, please fork/clone this repo. This is still running. I'm trying to implement all pseudo code while I'm learning the book.
